**🎮 Game Dev  | 📱 App Builder  |  🖌️ Pixel Artist   | 🧩 Always Solving Something.**

I don’t just write code — I forge ideas into tools, games, and apps worth wielding.  
Whether I’m crafting a pixelated world or solving a nasty bug, it’s always with intention.

## 🛠️ What I Do

- **Game Development**  
  → Original indie games built in Java using [libGDX](https://libgdx.com/)  
  → Pixel art and animations, all drawn from scratch

- **Android Development**  
  → Java/Kotlin apps with clean UIs and useful features  
  → Minimalist by design, purposeful by nature

- **Creative Problem Solving**  
  → Debugging, designing, and thinking in systems  
  → Making tools that feel seamless and satisfying

## 💡 Philosophy

> _Not just built, forged!_  
> Code isn’t a race — it’s craft. Every project is shaped with care, like a blade meant to last. I don’t push pixels or features unless they serve a purpose. No bloat. No noise. Just clarity, function, and edge.

## 🎲 Fun Fact

When I'm not coding or drawing sprites, I'm probably sketching up strange mechanics for the next project... or pretending I don’t already have five in progress.
